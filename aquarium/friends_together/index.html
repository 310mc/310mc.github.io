It&#39;s me! It&#39;s your Mamaaa~♪</p><p>Hahaha, if it feels awkward, then you don&#39;t have to force yourself to call me “Mama”… You don&#39;t have to be considerate towards people and disguise your true feelings.</p><p>That pure side of you can be tainted sooo easily, so I&#39;m worried for you, Chiaki-san…</p><p>Anyway, sorry, but I&#39;ll have to talk quietly. If it&#39;s hard to pick up what I&#39;m saying, then raise the volume on your side.</p><p>It says on the pamphlet to be respectful while talking on your phone inside the aquarium, sooo yeah…</p><p>I might annoy someone if I talk loudly.</p><p>Alright. Good, good… You&#39;re an obedient and good boy as always.</p><p>As a reward for being well-behaved, I&#39;ll clear off a liiittle bit of your stress.</p><p>Right now, I&#39;m at the aquarium for various reasons, but…</p><p>I&#39;m guessing that since Kanata-san can&#39;t join in with Ryuseitai&#39;s activities ‘cause of a problem that happened, it&#39;s causing you trouble, right?</p><p>I see. So it&#39;s not a trouble, but it is making you worried… Okay, then you should properly say that <em>that&#39;s</em> how you actually feel.</p><p>Even if you lie and say otherwise, someday those lies won&#39;t hold up anymore. Besides, Kanata-san is preeetty smart… He&#39;ll more likely feel lonely if you step away from him out of consideration.</p><p>Hahaha, that goes for both of you, I think. It seems like you both find each other so important that you end up holding back from each other…</p><p>Buuut y&#39;know, it&#39;s fine to fight each other with all you&#39;ve got every once in a while.</p><p><em>“Diamonds only form under extreme pressure.”</em><a class="msr-fn-inline" data-tippy-content="Originally, he says 雨降って地固まる &lt;em&gt;ame futte ji katamaru&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, which is an idiom to mean &quot;what doesn&amp;apos;t kill you makes you stronger&quot;. It&amp;apos;s also used in various tokusatsu shows." id="fnref:1">1</a> Aren&#39;t tokusatsu shows practically built on that concept?</p><p>Weeell, I plan to try and solve this problem as much as I can.</p><p>After all, I <em>did</em> leave literally everything behind to go off on a trip by myself… I need to do something — even if a little bit — for my former home, Ryuseitai.</p><p>Mhm, so you haven&#39;t heard much about Kanata-san&#39;s circumstances at home.</p><p>Ohh… So when he was gonna join Ryuseitai, he asked you to promise not to mention anything about that, I see.</p><p>That&#39;s why aaall you can do is just stand by and watch, huh? You&#39;re loyal to your promises.</p><p>Are you scared that he&#39;d drift away from Ryuseitai if you break that promise?</p><p>He&#39;s one of the Five Eccentrics — He has incredibly powerful capabilities within the school itself, not just Ryuseitai.</p><p>Aaand not only that, but you&#39;re also friends — pretty much just like family now, right? So you don&#39;t wanna separate from him, I understand.</p><p>But… His circumstances at home are a deep darkness he&#39;s carried since he was born. If you&#39;re gonna keep accompanying him, then someday you won’t be able to avoid it anymore.</p><p>If he&#39;s important to you, then don’t wait for that time to come — I want you to prepare yourself for this and break into it by yourself.</p><p>If you do that, you&#39;ll become a great man who can solve everything without harm, Chiaki-san… If anyone can do it, it&#39;s <em>you.</em></p><p>Even if I can&#39;t — Even if no one else can — <em>you</em> will be able to.</p><p>The only one who could make the cold, dark universe shine bright is the one who shines passionately himself: The sun.</p><p>And no matter how horrible the sight is after shining light upon it… Don&#39;t back away from it. Make sure to win the fight. That’s exactly what it means to be a hero, right?</p><p>Weeell, I found out that this problem is <em>really</em> trivial with the little inspecting I did…</p><p>It’ll probably solve itself one way or another. The worst case scenario is that I’ll end up having to try and end it quickly.</p><p>But I can’t truly solve this. The circumstances at Kanata-san’s home are deeply rooted within this whole region.</p><p>It’s a deep seated grudge from long past… Nothing could solve it — Not money, nor violence, nor any kind of authority.</p><p>Even the Student Council who’ve previously reformed the academy — <em>fine</em> and Akatsuki…</p><p>They avoided heavy involvement with his circumstances, and suppressed him by brushing it all off as being his own personal problem.</p><p>Because of that, there ended up being sooomething of an after-effect, and now Kanata-san is in all kinds of trouble.</p><p>He still has many unresolved problems of his own.</p><p>I could just say it’s all ‘cause of the Student Council, but eh, it’s too late for that… Nothing&#39;d come out of slamming Eichi-san or Keito-san’s face in.</p><p>All it’d do is make my fist hurt. This wouldn’t go like a tokusatsu show would, huh…</p><p>The only thing that can be done is to take time solving this — to slowly and carefully undo all the tangled knots.</p><p>And you’re reaaally good at stuff like that, right? Good luck, Chiaki-san.</p><p>Yep, if things start progressing, I’ll tell you about it in secret.</p><p>You probably can&#39;t focus due to how worried you are, but this is a really important time for Ryuseitai. As its reputation increases, your work has been increasing as well, right?</p><p>So focus on your practice sessions, and leave this to me. Don’t worry, I’ll do whatever I can so that Kanata-san can come home to Ryuseitai as soon as possible.</p><p>You’ll be able to say, <em>“The five of us together are Ryuseitai”</em> befooore you know it.</p><p>Haha, you’re so silly… You don’t need to thank me.</p><p>I couldn’t become a hero — I’m just an uncool guy who’s trying as hard as he can to make it up to the people he couldn’t protect, even though it&#39;s already so late.</p><p>Don’t look up to me… Don’t call someone like me “incredible”… Chiaki-san.</p><p>I want you to pursue your own kind of justice. I&#39;m sure that you, who loves heroes more than anyone, are correct in your justice.</p><p>Mhm. Bye byeee~ I’ll call you again.</p><p><span class="thought">(…Alright then. First off, time to go find the managers of the aquarium.)</span></p><p><span class="thought">(I’ll ask about what’s going on, and if it starts sounding like the worst case scenario, I’ll make them do things my way even if I have to threaten them.)</span></p><p><span class="thought">(In this country — In this time period — Gods barely have any real power, so this should be effective.)</span></p><p><span class="thought">(This is the only way I know how to do things… That’s why I fail as a hero.)</span></p></div></div><h2 id="Chapter-5">Chapter 5</h2><div class="msr-location"><p><span><b>Location:</b> Aquarium (Entrance)</span></p></div><img src="https://f005.backblazeb2.com/file/reitoouji/ro_iDtsi67571380Ys5.webp?timestamp=1733759880409"><div class="msr-unit" character="Wataru"><div class="msr-icon"><div class="msr-icon__wrapper"><div class="msr-icon__base"></div></div></div><div class="msr-name"></div><div class="msr-line"><p><em>Amazing!</em> How wonderful!</p><p>Once you’ve arrived at the site, they present you with the flashiest of sceneries and immerse you within it right away!
