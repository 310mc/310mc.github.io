He’s a real pain! This is my long-awaited date with Anzu-chan~!!</p><p>This date is why I cancelled all my other plans! I even woke up early today!</p><p>Woah—… Don’t pat my head to calm me down, Anzu-chan. You treat me like a kid sometimes~ <em>I’m</em> the senior here, y&#39;know?</p><p>It’s fine, though. Today’s a holiday, so the aquarium’s probably really crowded…</p><p>I bet we’ll get plenty of chances to sneak away and ditch Souma-kun in there so that we can finally have our alone time together.</p><p><em>Hmm?</em> Why&#39;re you looking at me suspiciously~?</p><p>Don&#39;t worry! I do wanna try and have a date with you as much as possible, but that doesn’t mean I’m not also worried about Kanata-kun! Really, I’m serious~♪</p><p>But honestly, I feel like it’s a little too early to start saying Kanata-kun’s gone missing.</p><p>It’s only been around a week since he took a break from school, right? And he hasn’t been going to Ryuseitai’s activities, either…</p><p>But that&#39;s all there is to it, right? He isn&#39;t a baby, so I feel like this is just worrying way too much over him.</p><p>I mean, he disappeared for a long time at the end of last year.</p><p>Huh? You didn’t know? He’s part of the Five Eccentrics — I think it’s just the Three Eccentrics now… He was that kinda person, that&#39;s why.</p><p>A lot happened to him back then. He may act like things don’t affect him, but he does go through a lot more than you might think.</p><p>But nowadays, it feels like he’s having fun pretty much every day.</p><p>So there wouldn’t be any reason for him to disappear… Maybe he’s not feeling well and took a break for his health?</p><p>His home is like, really protective of him, or something.</p><p>Either way… Just to make sure, my role is basically to find him and tell him to come back, right?</p><p>Or at the very least, you want me to ask him why he hasn’t been coming to school, right?</p><p>Okay then, but why me? I mean, I’m honored, but Kanata-kun already likes you quite a lot, Anzu-chan.</p><p>You can do it by yourself, can&#39;t you? I don’t need to be here.</p><p>It’s true that I&#39;m his friend, and I&#39;m also good at talking it out with people to some extent, so I <em>would</em> be suitable for something like this.</p><p>But soon enough, Ryuseitai will have a big job to do, so before that happens, they’ll want him back, right?</p><p>That&#39;s probably why you&#39;re helping out now, as a producer.</p><p>In that case, shouldn&#39;t Morisawa-kun be the one to take responsibility as the leader and talk to Kanata-kun?</p><p>Hmm… So that was what you intended to do at first, but when you looked around for more info, you found out it may be related to his circumstances at home.</p><p>That’s when Morisawa-kun told you that I’d be better equipped to handle it.</p><p>I feel like he&#39;s overestimating me… I may be the son of a locally famous person…</p><p>And that does mean I have deep connections with Kanata-kun&#39;s household, since they&#39;re rooted to this region&#39;s seaside…</p><p>But that&#39;s also exactly why it&#39;s going to be really tricky for me to approach him about it.</p><p>For once I, of all people, was able to be friends with a guy, so I don&#39;t want to make things awkward between us ‘cause of family-related things.</p><p>…Ahh, but don&#39;t worry. I don’t think it’s going to be that serious this time around.</p><p>I’ll do everything you’ve asked of me. It&#39;s a favor from you, so I have to do it.</p><p>Besides, his most likely hiding spot is in the aquarium, so…</p><p>While we’re there, I’ll get to act like I’m on a date with you.</p><p>Well, other than having a <em>child</em> accompanying us.</p></div></div><img src="https://f005.backblazeb2.com/file/reitoouji/ro_Igk67571380Xbz53.webp?timestamp=1733759882494"><div class="msr-unit" character="Souma"><div class="msr-icon"><div class="msr-icon__wrapper"><div class="msr-icon__base"></div></div></div><div class="msr-name"></div><div class="msr-line"><p>I apologize for making you wait… Do I look strange in this?

I worry that she has been fretting over that ever since.<a class="msr-fn-inline" data-tippy-content="Referring to what happened in &lt;a href&#x3D;&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kotofucius.github.io&#x2F;2017&#x2F;kiseki1-summer-live&#x2F;&quot; target&#x3D;&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Summer Live&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;." id="fnref:4">4</a></p><p>If that is indeed the case, then I only feel remorse.

Perhaps that is just how it is for a producer, however…</p><p>On top of fully assisting with Trickstar’s journey to SS, she is also prioritizing taking care of other units even more than she used to.</p><p>It is clearly too much for her. She will reach her limit soon enough. If she collapses from all of this, then it will be a disaster no one could ever bear or benefit from.</p><p>However, after taking on a strong front and lecturing her harshly, I cannot suddenly take everything back. As much as I want to, I cannot tell her to take it easy and rest.</p><p>It would only throw her off balance even further.</p><p>That is why… Mikejima-kun, could you let her know to relax every once in awhile for me?</p><p>And I would also like you to support her at all times, if you can.</p><p>Not that I even have to request that from you, though. You are the type to poke your nose in other people’s business, so I am sure you are already doing that.</p><p>However, if I recall correctly, you are close to Little Lady as you two are childhood friends, correct?</p><p>Then you are just the right person for this. After all, as far as I can tell from seeing my younger brother, childhood friends are like family.</p></div></div><h2 id="Chapter-5">Chapter 5</h2><div class="msr-unit" character="Madara"><div class="msr-icon"><div class="msr-icon__wrapper"><div class="msr-icon__base"></div></div></div><div class="msr-name"></div><div class="msr-line"><p>Mm~… Anzu-san’s like a big sister figure.
