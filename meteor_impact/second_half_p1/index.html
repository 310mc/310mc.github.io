No matter how much I stare at this billboard, nothing new will suddenly appear.

Both mean “you”, but <em>omae</em> is more rough and informal than <em>kimi</em>, so it gives off a much more casual or close feel. But it can also be rude to refer to someone with <em>omae</em>, since it’s typically used towards someone below you, which may be the reason behind Subaru’s reaction.</li><li id="fn:4"><a href="#fnref:4" class="arrow">↑</a> In the original, Subaru trails off before he elaborates, so it’s unclear whether he was asking a question or stating something.
