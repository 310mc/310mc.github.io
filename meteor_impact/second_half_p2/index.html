Having subjugated him is a significant feat.</p><p><em>fine</em> won with astoundingly better results than Valkyrie — No one could object to that fact.</p><p>This was the majority’s opinion. Or at the very least, the DreamFes system is designed to make everyone think that it is.</p><p>According to the DreamFes votes, the entire student body — the <em>public</em> wanted this result.</p><p>We managed to deal with the aftermath perfectly, too. We prepared everything in secret for that aforementioned day.</p><p>The Five Eccentrics are the evil that must be exterminated — And we, the Student Council, and the public supporting us, are part of justice.</p><p>That is the tale we’ll be writing.

In fact, that is what I have been doing this whole time: preparing and refining everything specifically for this tale.</p><p>The result was decided before the war had even begun. The only thing left to do is to dance to the tale&#39;s tune until the end.</p><p>We have to hurry as much as we can.
