class="note"><summary><p>2023/9/14: which story made you fall in love with midori?</p></summary><br><p>that would be <a href="/climax" target="_blank">climax</a> (repayment festival story)! hehe 🥰 tenka muteki meteorangers made me super interested in ryuseitai back in 2016, and midori’s distressed scream in the song is what convinced me to learn more about ryuseitai (most especially chiaki)</p><p>so my love for him started small and mostly out of curiosity to learn more about why there’s a screaming, distressed kid in the hero unit… then i read supernova (one of midori’s best 5* cards, i LOVE the wonder in his eyes) and i was soo amazed by his normie guy in a sparkly world storyline… but climax is what really sold me on his whole character, since it was the story that fully dug into his depth and character development.</p><p>i love what climax tells us about midori, it’s so relatable… i also had a very depressing/colorless teenage life, so his story resonated a lot with me and made me so happy to see midori receive the love and joy that he thought he doesn’t deserve, that he never even expected to get. but what i love the most is that he turned all that guilt/pressure of receiving &quot;undeserved&quot; love into a resolve to repay ryuseitai for everything they gave him. it’s so powerful and inspiring!!</p><p>climax just encompasses everything beautiful about midori… his compassion, his potential, his true feelings, his relationship with ryuseitai, what makes him unique, etc… i was set for life to love him after that story came out lmaoo 😭 (no regrets)</p></details><details class="note"><summary><p>2023/11/25: haii do you have the translation or know the name of the story/chapter in !era where chiaki heckles akiomi in a crowd and calls him four eyes but akiomi points him out directly and gives him detention? anyways tysmm for translating so many ryuseitai stories ^_^</p></summary><br><p>hello!! that’d be from the very first main story in ! era !! it’s in chapter 132 of ensemble, and can be read <a href="https://mainstoryarchive.tumblr.com/post/759139930470498304/ensemble-132-victory-and-defeat" target="_blank">here</a>!</p><p>here is an old translation i made of it because it’s just so funny lol:</p><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F_z_GtMWoAAUFcs?format=png&name=900x900"> <img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F_z_HDMXEAAl5oo?format=png&name=900x900"> <img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F_z_HZ1WUAA-J70?format=png&name=900x900"></details><details class="note"><summary><p>2023/11/26: was it ever said what ryuseitai color chiaki was in his 2nd year, before he became ryusei red?</p></summary><br><p>chiaki never had a ryusei color, and he wasn’t a member of the &quot;main&quot; squad in ryuseitai either, until the battle vs the sea god happened that gave him the opportunity to wear the red uniform in battle! when madara told him to wear any of the uniforms he likes, chiaki said he was interested in wearing the red one. this is in <a href="/meteor_impact/second_half_p2" target="_blank">chapter 25 of the second half in meteor impact</a></p><p>in other words, he never got to wear any ryuseitai uniform at all prior to the battle. it’s possible that the ryuseitai uniforms weren’t even used by anyone for quite a long time, as chiaki states that &quot;they were hidden deep down inside here&quot;, implying ryuseitai became so corrupt and lost hold of its history and legacy that nobody would wear the uniforms anymore. this is in <a href="/meteor_impact/second_half_p3" target="_blank">chapter 30</a></p></details><details class="note"><summary><p>2024/1/8: HIII!! Loveyour translations! I was just curious, upon reading orihime and hikoboshi, subaru stated that chiaki once got angry at him, is there any particular story that shows this scene?</p></summary><br><p>hello!! i’m so glad to hear that~</p><p>the quote in question is the one in <a href="/orihime_and_hikoboshi/threat_of_rain" target="_blank">threat of rain 5</a>, right?</p><p>&quot;If you plan on learning from us, come back inside. We’d be in hot water too if you ended up collapsing.<br>Chi~chan-senpai’d get <em>furious</em> with me. I saw him angry like that only once, and it was seriously terrifying.&quot;</p><p>i’d like to clarify that subaru isn’t saying that chiaki got angry at him before, but rather that he has <em>seen</em> chiaki getting furiously angry before, and it was terrifying to witness.</p><p>we don’t have any story that shows the scene subaru is referring to. but we <em>have</em> had one scene of chiaki showing extreme anger before, and it was in the ! era main story.</p><p>the context is that before the ryuseitai vs fine match started, he got furious with eichi for making his junior, subaru, suffer (making trickstar disband, which left subaru all on his own until chiaki came to the rescue, etc…). it’s in <a href="https://mainstoryarchive.tumblr.com/post/759136690132713472/ensemble-111-justice" target="_blank">ensemble chapter 111, justice</a>, and it went something like this:</p><p><strong>Chiaki:</strong> &quot;Huh, I wonder about that, O arrogant Emperor. You make light of them [Trickstar] far too much.<br>Besides, can you even afford to think ahead right now? Just so you know, we plan to fight and win against you. If you start spacing out, the rug will be pulled from under your feet!<br><strong>……You’ve taken great care of my cute junior. It’s time I returned the favor.&quot;</strong><br><strong>Eichi:</strong> &quot;Oh? So that’s your motive, is it? I can’t deny, I didn’t see this coming.&quot;</p><p>the bolded is where he sounds audibly angry in the voiced story. the main story is fully voiced, so you can hear how it’s voiced in enstars basic!</p><p>i don’t think subaru is referring to the ! era main story scene, as he wasn’t there for it (he was with makoto, trying his best to make it in time to perform as trickstar). so for the scene that subaru himself witnessed, i don’t think we’ve seen it!</p></details><details class="note"><summary><p>2024/11/22: is there a particular reason tetora used to address kanata as “shinkai-san” in early ! stories? or is it just inconsistency in the writing</p></summary><br><p>these are remnants of the way ryuseitai used to refer to each other in the early stories (particularly 2015-2016), and so you’ll likely find them in very old story fan translations or in old physically released content (like the first ryuseitai CD drama from 2015). it’s not just shinkai-san, there was also:</p><ul><li>shinobu used to call midori &quot;takamine-dono&quot; (was in hero show and the drama CD)</li><li>tetora used to sometimes call chiaki &quot;leader&quot; instead of &quot;taichou&quot; (bits of this still exists in ! era main story, and drama CD)</li><li>tetora used to call shinobu &quot;shinobu-kun&quot; from as early as piratefes, a story set in summer</li><li>midori used to call chiaki &quot;taichou&quot; in hero show and drama CD, &quot;buchou&quot; in 2015 sportsfes</li><li>shinkai-san used to be in hero show too</li><li>there were likely more so this is just a rough list!</li></ul><p>it seems that eventually, enstars finally settled on how they want each ryuseitai member to refer to each other, so a lot of the stories got their namings adjusted in-game after months of their release. now in-game, hero show has shinobu say &quot;midori-kun&quot;, all of tetora’s &quot;shinobu-kun&quot;’s that chronologically happen before repayment festival were changed to &quot;sengoku-kun&quot; since climax (repayment festival) is when tetora consciously makes an effort to switch namings, and so on and so forth.</p><p>but again, there’s still some small remains of the initial namings not just in old fan translations, like the physically released drama CD from 2015, or the first main story of ! era.</p><p>as for why the characters used to call each other with those names at first, i’m not sure because i came to the fandom in late 2016 🤔 i guess they felt like it worked at the time enstars was released, but as the characters got more depth and shape, they decided it’d make more sense to settle on certain other namings.</p><p>i can see why they’d change takamine-dono for example, because it <em>is</em> strange that shinobu would call midori that when he calls tetora &quot;tetora-kun&quot; (and eventually it’s established in Sparkly First Years that shinobu and midori got along as early as when they first joined school, so &quot;midori-kun&quot; definitely fits a lot more). and although &quot;shinkai-san&quot; is polite and suits tetora’s respectful way of speaking, it sounds more distant than &quot;shinkai-senpai&quot; (which more clearly refers to him as a senpai from the same school).</p><p>for midori, maybe they figured it’d make most sense that he doesn’t keep switching between &quot;taichou&quot;, &quot;buchou&quot;, and &quot;morisawa-senpai&quot; all depending on where he is with chiaki (unit, club, or any other situation), and made him settle with morisawa-senpai. on that note, hero show has a moment where midori calls him &quot;buchou&quot;, and then chiaki tells him to call him &quot;taichou&quot; when they’re doing unit activities, not &quot;buchou&quot;… this is still in the story to this day (and didn’t get adjusted). so since it remained as part of canon, i like to imagine that midori got tired of constantly needing to switch depending on the place and went for something easier. but this is completely speculation!! most of these namings got silently changed (except for the buchou/taichou from midori) so we’re prooobably meant to see most of it as &quot;that was how they were always referring to each other from the beginning&quot; LOL</p></details><details class="note"><summary><p>2024/11/29: When looking up Chiaki, I saw on his wiki page in the trivia section that he has watched Precure/Pretty Cure. Is this true? If so, where can I find translations for it?</p></summary><br><p>i think mika_enstars got to answering this <a href="https://x.com/mika_enstars/status/1861309603872416168">here</a>, so i’ll add the translation of when he mentions it in the mini talk ♪</p><p>from the 2016 mini talk for <a href="https://ensemble-stars.fandom.com/wiki/Secret_Acts!_The_Moonlight_Scroll_of_the_Elements/Chiaki_Morisawa_Normal_Event">scroll of the elements</a>:</p><p>&quot;Oh, Anzu!

Anzu, so you’re more familiar with the magical girl shows, huh?<br>It’s broadcasted after tokusatsu shows, so I’ve also seen it before.&quot;</p><p>as a bonus; not fully related to pretty cure per se, but anzu mentions magical girl shows again to him in his <a href="https://310mc.github.io/birthday_story/chiaki/2023/">2023 birthday</a>:</p><p>&quot;Ha ha ha!! ☆ Morisawa Blue has arrived~!<br>Fufu, just kidding.

yes, it is what the japanese text says, but not with the meaning you may think…!</p><p>gravure modeling refers to photoshoots specifically to make the model look attractive and cool. for examples, <a href="https://nijimen.kusuguru.co.jp/topics/24696">here’s a gravure photoshoot for leo’s VA, asanuma</a>, and <a href="https://item.rakuten.co.jp/shosen/c/0000000867/">here’s all sorts of male idols doing gravure photoshoots</a> (scroll down until you see photos of male idols with a red price tag underneath).</p><p>it’s essentially photoshoots of the model looking cool or handsome specifically to appeal to the viewers. it’s why midori vents about it in <a href="https://310mc.github.io/motor_show/snails_pace">motor show, snail’s pace 5</a>, because he tends to feel conflicted when his looks stand out more than who he is inside, as he doesn’t feel like that &quot;cool-looking model&quot; side represents who he truly is. it’s also a recurring topic in his <a href="https://310mc.github.io/staying_true_to_myself/">FS1</a> and <a href="https://310mc.github.io/true_to_myself_taking_a_step_forward">FS2</a> !!</p><p>thank you for asking, i should have added a translation note about this earlier… 😓 so moving forward i’ll be having a translation note for gravure modeling any time it appears , and it’s also been added to my published translations o7</p></details><details class="note"><summary><p>2025/9/8: hi !! i wanted to know in which story is stated that kuro recomended tetora to chiaki. thanks</p></summary><br><p>it’s from four beasts of fistfighting, a sun in the palm of your hand chapter 5!!</p><p>to be more accurate, four beasts (february 2017, set in late winter) mentions that kuro introduced tetora to ryuseitai, and then later in sparkly first years (march 2017, set in early spring), chiaki mentions that he saw tetora and his &quot;hero sensors went off&quot;, so he offered him an invitation to ryuseitai (and then waited a few days for his response). so it’s a little unclear how this all went down, and it could be interpreted as two separate events (for example: kuro telling tetora about ryuseitai, and chiaki seeing tetora and immediately being interested in inviting him without knowing kuro’s involvement)</p><p>it’s absolutely important dialogue from a beautiful story, so i’ll post a screenshot of it from <a href="https://healingbonds.dreamwidth.org/15914.html" target="_blank">healingbond’s translation</a>:</p><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/G0RqZxGXEAAZ4-s?format=jpg&name=900x900"></details><details class="note"><summary><p>2025/9/8: what happend to kanata in purple wisterias of may? why was he crying</p></summary><br><p>please excuse my long answer, i’m bad at writing short answers…</p><p><strong>for the short answer:</strong></p><p>based on wisteria alone, we don’t truly get the answer. the story is set in early spring (so school had only just started), and it starts with kanata crying in the ocean. souma was looking for him and finds him there, and when he realizes he’s crying, he gets worried and wonders what’s wrong. kanata is bothered by the ruckus he’s making, and then laughs saying not to worry, the salty wind got in his eyes.</p><p>after that, they talk a bit about club duties kanata has to settle which eventually kanata says how it’s a pain but okay, he doesn’t want to go home anyway, and he was planning to sleep over in the clubroom. souma gets worried hearing that and offers kanata to stay at his home instead as he has something he wants to speak to him about anyway, and so kanata accepts and ends up staying in souma’s house</p><p>the rest of kanata’s scenes in the story mention his uncertainty as part of ryuseitai, especially with the new ryuseitai juniors, his frustrations with madara, but also eventually expressing that he doesn’t hate madara, and he’s glad that thanks to madara he got to meet chiaki.</p><p>that’s the short answer to explain the crying scene itself. from here on is <strong>an extended answer</strong> of my own attempt to explain a possible reason why he was crying, so please consider it an optional read in case you want to learn more!</p><p>for the longest time his crying scene remained a bit of a mystery. obviously it must have had something to do with his home, and people theorized he may have a bad relationship with his family. but then aquarium was released a few months later, revealing how he cares for his household and they care for him back but he’s been also trying to protect what matters to him (the aquarium) and that caused a conflict between the two.</p><p>(i remember at the time of wisteria’s release, i jokingly theorized the kanata crying CG exists just to complete the &quot;ryuseitai crying CG collection&quot; because climax came out with so many angsty CGs and it was only kanata left for one LOL)</p><p>but now, with meteor impact, !! era stories, and especially stella maris revealing so much about kanata, there can be a theory made on what that scene was implying. this is my own interpretation, but firstly, the things we learn about kanata in stella maris helps here. kanata recounts his time as a god, saying that he shut his memories away and convinced himself that he doesn’t want madara around to protect madara from harm, and that he did this for so long that he eventually became empty inside.</p><p>that empty kanata is who chiaki met in meteor impact, and by doing all the things kanata loves (hero acts, talking about heroes), chiaki slowly brought back all the things kanata always loved in the past, that he had locked away. but chiaki also introduced kanata to so much more: that he is not a god, but a <em>human</em>, and that he can be friends with &quot;regular&quot; people. that’s something kanata never truly realized about himself until chiaki expressed it clearly to him.</p><p>so (my personal interpretation of the events start here) from there on, kanata spends a lot of his time, especially during his 3rd year, regaining that humanity. regaining the memories he locked away, trying to make sense of the confusing feelings he has inside. after all, the feeling and concept of &quot;loneliness&quot; (which kanata had expressed feeling when he was young) is also something he blocked himself from acknowledging for so long until he felt it so strongly again in meteor impact, so surely there were many other feelings he was starting to feel again and try to make sense of</p><p>so now… what could have made kanata cry while in the ocean? other things we know is that in altered, 2nd year kanata (when he was still a god) doesn’t believe his mom has &quot;died&quot;, but became one with the ocean. i’ll show the dialogue itself, translation by <a href="https://twilightmalachite.tumblr.com/post/719181423390621697/altered-heaven-and-hell-13" target="_blank">Mika Enstars</a>:</p><p>Natsume: I might not fully understaND, bUT… That means Kanata-niisan’s mommy passed awAY, hUH? It seems like unpleasant memories were brought back uP.</p><p>Kanata: Mommie? No, my &quot;mother&quot; only finished her role. As a &quot;goddess&quot;, she does not die, even after passing away.<br>She has become one with the vast &quot;sea&quot;, and watches over us even today.<br>So, even if I cannot swim, I &quot;love&quot; to splash around in the ocean.<br>It is like I am being held by mother.<br>It wasn’t all good things, I would even get &quot;reprimanded&quot; from time to time. Because they were a very strict person back when I lived a normal life.<br>But, she was always right at all times, so if I ever get lost, I splash in the sea. And I’d ask, &quot;let me know the answer&quot;.</p><p>so one interpretation of his crying scene in wisteria is… perhaps he was feeling lonely, or just lost, and now that a lot of his humanity was returning in him (and therefore a lot of his &quot;human&quot; emotions and memories), he was in the sea to find answers once again? 2nd year and 3rd year kanata show signs that he doesn’t yet know the truth of what actually happened to his mom (i.e. the reveal we learn in abyss after kanata graduates), so it’s possible that to him this was still what felt like a way to connect with his mom.</p><p>and in that wisteria scene with souma… after kanata spends the night in souma’s house, the next day kanata remembers mid into his conversation with souma that there was ryuseitai practice today, so he wants to go and let chiaki know he’s taking the day off (so he can help souma with the &quot;slasher&quot; person in school), but souma encouraged him to properly go to the practice session and be with his unit. kanata seems conflicted, saying ryuseitai &quot;doesn’t sit well with him somehow&quot;, and that he doesn’t know how exactly to get on with the juniors in the unit. despite being in ryuseitai and being a senior in it, he was still feeling distant and lost in his own way, and so that crying scene could’ve been a moment of him being vulnerable in the presence/embrace of his &quot;mother&quot;.</p><p>as for why he then says he doesn’t want to go home, i feel that it may have to do with what we later on learn in aquarium, that his own &quot;selfish&quot; desires are starting to blossom and it clashes with his household that are overly protective of him as their god. it’s possible that he wasn’t in the mood to go home and be back to his god duties that day, and wanted a time off from it. and if you consider how the next day, he tried to even take a day off from ryuseitai too, it does somewhat add up</p><p>but this is purely my own interpretation and isn’t fully based on something concrete, it’s just what i figure could be the answer since 3rd year kanata has a few instances where he has to go and do some god duty (like how in orihime and hikoboshi, he mentions needing to do ceremonies in the summer). plus, kanata goes on to remodel his household’s religion by the time he graduates, to fit better with modern standards. this eventually gave him a lot more freedom and less need to constantly do god duties, and it’s part of why !! era kanata feels a lot more in touch with who he is as a person (and why he could eventually talk about himself in stella)</p><p>there’s other ways to possibly interpret it, like something bad had happened at home (hence him not wanting to go home), but personally i settled with the above interpretation! but we never get the one true answer for it, so it’s up to interpretation. 3rd year kanata is very fascinating to look back on after what he revealed about himself in stella, as it finally gives context to why kanata seemed so distant in his 3rd year (especially the early days)!</p></details><details class="note"><summary><p>2025/9/29: hello, i hope this message finds you well :’) thank you for sharing with us all your translations. i’ve been thinking about it for a long time but i was wondering which story talks about shinobu running for stuco presidency? i am still catching up with a lot of stories but i saw it brought up and got curious which stories those are on.
